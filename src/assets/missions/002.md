> Mission Parameters: Intel places the nearest transmitter within a nearby financial distric. The area is densely packed with tall buildings, and there are reports that the Vestian Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets in defense of its strongpoints throughout the city.
> The existence of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal; anticipate systemic invasion and localized sensor jamming and optical camoflauge capabilities.
