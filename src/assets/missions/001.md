## The Drop

*“Set condition to 1-Azure. Scramble all pilots and ground focres. Prepare to drop...”*  


# Goals

- Land at Forward Operating Base Saber.
- Await further orders.
- Do not fire unless fired upon.

# Stakes

- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.
